# MODULE-2 OPERATORES

# 1.	
# A. Write an equation which relates 399, 543 and 12345

12345 != 399 + 543


# B. “When I divide 5 with 3, I got 1. But when I divide -5 with 3, I got -2”—How would you justify it.

a = 5//3 == 1
print(a)

b = -5//3 == -2
print(b)

      
# 2. a=5,b=3,c=10.. What will be the output of the following:
    
a = 5
b = 3
c = 10

# A. a/=b

a = a/b
print(a)


# B. c*=5

c = c*5
print(c)  

    
# 3. 
# A. How to check the presence of an alphabet ‘s’ in word “Data Science”.

text = "Data Science"
count_s = text.count('s')
print(count_s)

            
# B. How can you obtain 64 by using numbers 4 and 3.
